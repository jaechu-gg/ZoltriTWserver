:straight_ruler: Please read these rules carefully, and check back often to see if they've changed: :straight_ruler:

1. Do not curse/voodoo non-hooligans without cause.
2. No PvP logging.

### :video_game: UNPLAYABLE :video_game:   
What this is:
```
I can't go to my base, but I also can't fix whatever is stopping me from going there.
I'm a newcomer and I've been cursed with waking nightmare.
I get disconnected/lag from what they did near/in my base.
I have been teleported without my permission more than once in 24 hours by the same person/group of people.
```

What this isn't:
```
I don't feel safe while they are online.
They make me mad by talking in chat (/ignore!)
They keep cursing me with something that doesn't kill me.
They stole my hard-to-make gear through legitimate means and now I have to start again.
I haven't actually been teleported without my permission, but they're ruining all my poppets.
```

### :headphones: Discord rules: :headphones: 
1. Your nick must have some indication of who you are in-game
2. If you don't have your correct role, put your name and chosen role in #i-need-a-role 
3. Other discord server links are OK as long as they're not for other minecraft servers
4. Respect the :speak_no_evil: voice channel! It's not for shouting or boisterous activity. Other channels are unrestricted.

### :bookmark_tabs: Griefing :bookmark_tabs:  
- Unclaimed bases (use a stick on the ground to check) are FREE REAL ESTATE to loot as you please, first come first serve.
- Griefing WILL NOT be acted upon (rolled back/refunded) or investigated if the window in which it occurred is more than 7 days not inclusive (that means >7 days not >=7 days).

As always, if you have ANY questions, feel free to PM me! And please do so BEFORE doing something questionable, not after.
